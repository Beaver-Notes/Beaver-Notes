Places I've officially uploaded the latest stable versions to are [dafont.com](http://dafont.com/open-dyslexic.font) and gumroad(see link at [opendyslexic.org](http://opendyslexic.org).)

The latest version may not always be the best version. If you want a stable version, check [github](https://github.com/antijingoist/open-dyslexic/tags) for the latest stable or working beta including otf's and ttf's, or [DaFont](http://dafont.com/open-dyslexic.font) for a stable otf.

If you are upgrading your copy of this font, you may want to remove previous version first. 

Typeface/font to help readability, and help readability for some of the symptoms of dyslexia.

Your brain can sometimes do funny things to letters. OpenDyslexic tries to help prevent some of these things from happening. Letters have heavy weighted bottoms to provide an indication of orientation to make it more difficult to confuse with other similar letters. Consistently weighted bottoms can also help reenforce the line of text. The unique shapes of each letter can help prevent flipping and swapping.

The italic style for OpenDyslexic has been crafted still be able to be used for emphasis while still being readable. 

Install:
========
Windows: Copy .OTF files to C:\Windows\Fonts

It is based on Bitstream Vera Sans because of the nice license it has. 

OpenDyslexic is not packaged by me as an .exe file. It is packaged as a zip file, with no installer,  so you know what you are getting.

If you were compelled to pay for this font, ask for a refund. This font is provided at no charge. Donations are cool, but optional. :)
