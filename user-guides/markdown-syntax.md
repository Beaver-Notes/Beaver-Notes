# ✒️ Markdown syntax

## What's Markdown

Markdown is a simple text formatting language that makes it easy to style and structure your text. You can use basic symbols, like \*\* and ##, to create headings, lists, links, and more. Markdown helps you focus on content without getting bogged down by complex formatting, making it a perfect tool for quick and clean writing.

## The syntax

{% hint style="info" %}
This section of the docs doesn't cover the whole markdown syntax but only the syntax supported by Beaver Notes if what you are trying to type isn't in here it's probably not supported
{% endhint %}

### Headings

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
##### Heading 6
```

### Formatting&#x20;

<pre class="language-markdown"><code class="lang-markdown"><strong>I just love **bold text**
</strong>Italicized text is the *cat's meow*
Highlited text is the ==dog's bark==
`Inline code`
~~This text has been strikethrough~~
</code></pre>

### Lists

1. This is an ordered list
- this is an unordered list
[ ] This is a check list
