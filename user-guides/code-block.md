# ðŸ’» Code block

## Inserting a codeblock&#x20;

To insert a code block in your note, you can simply type \`\`\` or \~\~\~ followed by a space to create a code block. Alternatively, you can click the code block icon in the menubar or press Control Alt C (Cmd Alt C on macOS)

## Setting up VSCode

By default, VSCode doesn't support copying code with formatting. However, you can go into VSCode's settings, look for and disable 'Copy With Syntax Highlight.'"
